Build a Virtual Pet
Use your programming skills to create a digital pet that users can name, feed, and care for
over time. Your pet should respond to how well it is treated, showing emotions, changing
appearance or behavior, and developing based on the user’s actions.
To expand your program, include a "cost of care" system to teach users about the financial
responsibility of pet ownership. Track things like:
    • Food and supply costs
    • Vet visits or health care
    • Toy or activity purchases
    • Budget limits or in-game currency
Your program should include:
    • Customization (user names the pet, chooses type, etc.)
    • Pet care features (feed, play, rest, clean, health check)
    • Reactions based on care level (happy, sick, sad, energetic)
    • A running total of care-related expenses
    • Optional: savings goals or earning systems (e.g., chores or tasks to earn pet care funds)
Encourage creativity in how the pet grows or changes over time: Could it evolve, learn tricks,
or earn badges? Use any programming language or environment that demonstrates your
understanding of basic logic, variables, conditionals, and functions.
